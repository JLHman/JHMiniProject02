 # INF601 - Advanced Programming in Python
 Jesse Heckman
Mini Project 2 
 
Python program to extract and display data about several stocks.  This project was completed for the INF 601 class at 
Fort Hayes University.  This project is an introduction to PANDAS data frames.

## PANDAS

`pandas` is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
Additional information about `pandas` is available at here: [Ten minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)

## Objectives

-     (5/5 points) Initial comments with your name, class and project at the top of your .py file.
-    (5/5 points) Proper import of packages used.
-    (20/20 points) Using a data source of your choice, such as data from data.gov or using the Faker package, generate or retrieve some data for creating basic statistics on. This will generally come in as json data, etc.      
-    (10/10 points) Store this information in Pandas dataframe. These should be 2D data as a dataframe, meaning the data is labeled tabular data.
-    (10/10 points) Using matplotlib, graph this data in a way that will visually represent the data. Really try to build some fancy charts here as it will greatly help you in future homework assignments and in the final project.
-    (10/10 points) Save these graphs in a folder called charts as PNG files. Do not upload these to your project folder, the project should save these when it executes. You may want to add this folder to your .gitignore file.
-    (10/10 points) There should be a minimum of 5 commits on your project, be sure to commit often!
-    (10/10 points) I will be checking out the master branch of your project. Please be sure to include a requirements.txt file which contains all the packages that need installed. You can create this fille with the output of pip freeze at the terminal prompt.
-    (20/20 points) There should be a README.md file in your project that explains what your project is, how to install the pip requirements, and how to execute the program. Please use the GitHub flavor of Markdown. Be thorough on the explanations.

## Install 
`pip install -r requirements text`
This will install all of the modules that you will need for the program. 

**Special note!** If you chose to import the packages individually make sure to use matplotlib 3.5.3.

## Running the program
To run this program clicking the green code button `clone` the code and run in you're preferred python editor.
